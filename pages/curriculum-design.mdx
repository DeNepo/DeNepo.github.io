This is a collection of curriculum design principles that I've invented (or discovered?) since I started teaching programming. Some of them I've used for many years and have been the foundation of my teaching, others are new and I hope to use soon.

Inspired by the [Pedagogy Quick Reads](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/tag/quickread/), I've tried to introduce each of these design principles as something simple and actionable. To learn more about the ideas behind these design princples, you can find them [in my notes](https://evancole.be/notes). The notes are less clear than these pages but will have more detail, links to relevant literature, open questions, and all sorts of linked ideas.
