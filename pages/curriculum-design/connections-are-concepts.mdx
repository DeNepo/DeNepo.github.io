Programming is complicated, there are many concepts to learn and all of the concepts are related. A simple way to approach this is to say that your learners have two types of knowledge to build:

- **Concepts**: The individual concepts of programming, things like _*variables*_ and _*APIs*_ and _*repositories*_. Studying each of these concepts separately is important but not enough.
- **Connections**: How individual concepts relate to each other. For example once you understand variables and arrays separately, you will still need to study _*reference vs. value*_ (how _*variables*_ store _*arrays*_ in memory).

However this Concept/Connection distinction can be blurry; is **reference vs. value** a _Concept_ or a _Connection_?

I've find it helpful to think of each Connection as just another Concept. The biggest advantage to this approach has been to ....... asdf

When defining learning objectives, this framing can help to avoid overlooking or hand-waving away tricky and important objectives like _reference vs. value_.

- Then you'll make room in your learning objectives and schedule to teach this properly
- Making space in your curriculum for these tricky connecting concepts may also help with [[Learner Trust]] by implicitly acknowledging that something will be challenging, and the learner isn't expected to "just figure it out" or "get it later". #question
