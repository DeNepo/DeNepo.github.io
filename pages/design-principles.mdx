Above all De Nepo is about designing open educational resources that work for all sorts of learners, educators and educational contexts. We know that no design will work perfectly for everyone, so before explaining our solutions we want to share our design principles.

We hope these design princples can make your education more accessible, whether by helping you use use our resources directly or by guiding your own designs.

## Curriculum Design

- **Learner Trust**: The foundation of any successful curriculum is the learners' trust. If you as an educator can maintain your learners' trust, you will be able to work through problems in the curriculum's design. If you lose your learners' trust, it does not matter how amazing your content is.
- **Time is Importance**: One of the hardest and most important decisions in curriculum design is _what not to teach_. Removing some objectives to make more time for others can help build **Learner Trust** by sending the message that this topic important, is not easy to learn, and there will be support.
- **Explicitly Teach the Implicit**: Make the time in your curriculum and in your class to explicitly teach skills that experienced developers take for granted, or don't even notice. Such as knowing how to read a file of code, or how to do a good internet search. Even if a learner _could_ figure this out by trial and error, this will take a lot of time, is not guaranteed, and can harm **Learner Trust**.
- **Name Things**: Name tiny concepts that experienced programmers take for granted. Naming small concepts will help learners isolate, practice and discuss these concepts. Naming a comcept also emphasizes that it is important, and that it's something learners are not expected to know yet. Naming things is one strategy for **Explicitly teaching the Implicit**.

## Content & Tooling Design

- **Study Code, Not Explanations**: 1) Teach learners how to study code. 2) Provide the resources to study code effectively. 3) Write level-appropriate code intended for study. 4) Allow learners construct their own understanding.
- **Learner-Accessible Tooling**: Design your content authoring and managment processes so learners can realistically adapt the content to their needs. Having all aspects of a course be learner-accessible is not always realistic, but making as much of the content learner-accessible as possible will go a long way.
- **Context is Content**: Where and how a learner studies something is a learning objective, whether you inteded it to be or not. Design your learners' study and class workflows to mirror professional workflows so the time they spend navigating your course doubles as a learning objective.
- **Peel Away Principle**: Design configurable layers of pedagogical support _on top of_ existing development environemnts. These layers can be gradually peeled away to reveal a full development environment. This approach to scaffolding can help ease skill transfer costs, and avoid the expertise reversal effect.
